# Housing Valley

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A project based on dart. A application that help people to predict house prices using the machine laerning model. 

House	 price	 prediction	 is	 a	 very	 appropriate	 and	 prime	 region	 of	 application,	 accompanying	
important	associations	 for	people,	business,	and	 the	overall	saving.	Accurately	calling	building	
prices	can	help	things	form	conversant	resolutions	about	purchasing	or	sale	feature,	and	can	help	
business	in	the	land	manufacturing	to	better	forecast	market	trends	and	create	more	cognizant	
property	determinations.	This	somewhat	maybe	very	active	and	most	beneRicial	to	people	who	
are	moving	in	into	the	city	for	the	Rirst	time.	For	example,	in	the	city	of	Bangalore	that	is	popular	
as	the	startup	hub	where	thousands	of	people	migrate	into	to	city	daily,	there	is	a	high	need	for	
such	applications.	With	this	sort	of	dense	population	and	diversity,	it	could	be	useful	in	expanding	
main	 algorithms	 and	 information	 evaluation	 methods	 to	 supply	 greater	 correct	 estimates	 of	
assets	values,	decreasing	the	hazard	of	over- or	beneath-appraisal.
